### Build instructions

After installing the required headers and CMake config files on your distro, the `install.sh` script can be run.

After this the runner shows up in systemsettings:  
`systemsettings kcm_plasmasearch`

You can also launch KRunner via Alt-F2 or Alt-Space and you will find your runner.

If you feel confident about your runner you can upload it to the KDE Store
https://store.kde.org/browse?cat=628&ord=latest.
