     * This is the main query method. It should trigger creation of
     * QueryMatch instances through RunnerContext::addMatch and
     * RunnerContext::addMatches.
     *
     * If the runner can run precisely the requested term (RunnerContext::query()),
     * it should create an exact match by setting the type to RunnerContext::ExactMatch.
     * The first runner that creates a QueryMatch will be the
     * default runner. Other runner's matches will be suggested in the
     * interface. Non-exact matches should be offered via RunnerContext::PossibleMatch.
     *
     * The match will be activated via run() if the user selects it.
     *
     * Each runner is executed in its own thread. Whenever the user input changes this
     * method is called again. Thus, it needs to be thread-safe. Also, all matches need
     * to be reported once this method returns. Asynchronous runners therefore need
     * to make use of a local event loop to wait for all matches.
     *
     * It is recommended to use local status data in async runners. The simplest way is
     * to have a separate class doing all the work like so:
     *
     * \code
     * void MyFancyAsyncRunner::match(RunnerContext &context)
     * {
     *     QEventLoop loop;
     *     MyAsyncWorker worker(context);
     *     connect(&worker, &MyAsyncWorker::finished, &loop, &MyAsyncWorker::quit);
     *     worker.work();
     *     loop.exec();
     * }
     * \endcode
     *
     * Here MyAsyncWorker creates all the matches and calls RunnerContext::addMatch
     * in some internal slot. It emits the finished() signal once done which will
     * quit the loop and make the match() method return. The local status is kept
     * entirely in MyAsyncWorker which makes match() trivially thread-safe.
     *
     * If a particular match supports multiple actions, set up the corresponding
     * actions in the actionsForMatch method. Do not call any of the action methods
     * within this method!
     *
     * Execution of the correct action should be handled in the run method.
     * @caution This method needs to be thread-safe since KRunner will simply
     * start a new thread for each new term.
     *
     * @warning Returning from this method means to end execution of the runner.
     *
     * @sa run(), RunnerContext::addMatch, RunnerContext::addMatches, QueryMatch
